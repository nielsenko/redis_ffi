# Files to exclude from published package.
#
# When .pubignore exists, .gitignore is NOT used for publishing.
# We want to include native/lib/ (prebuilt binaries) in the package,
# but exclude build artifacts and development files.

# Dart build artifacts
.dart_tool/

# Zig build artifacts (not needed - we include prebuilt binaries)
native/.zig-cache/
native/zig-out/

# Development files
dump.rdb

# CI/CD
.github/

# The native/lib/ directory with prebuilt binaries is NOT ignored here,
# so it will be included in the published package.
