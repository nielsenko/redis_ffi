# Files to exclude from published package.
#
# When .pubignore exists, .gitignore is NOT used for publishing.
# We want to include native/lib/ (prebuilt binaries) in the package,
# but exclude build artifacts and development files.

# Dart build artifacts
.dart_tool/
build/

# Zig source files, build artifacts and config (not needed for published package)
native/build.zig
native/build.zig.zon
native/src/
native/zig-out/
native/.zig-cache/
.zig-version

# Development files
dump.rdb

# CI/CD
.github/

# The native/lib/ directory with prebuilt binaries is NOT ignored here,
# so it will be included in the published package.
